# Welcome to Fish Frenzy
Fish Frenzy is a simple GBA game, created as a part of CS 2110 at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
## Instructions
In the following game, you will navigate a helpless, little fish through a dangerous sea of predators to try and reach the coral reef. If you collide with any of the predators, your fish will be eaten and die, causing the game to end. However, if you safely make it to the coral reef, you will win the game and see your final score. A lower score indicates a faster, more efficient journey, or better performance. You can keep track of your score in the top right corner of the screen as you play the game.
## Controls
Use the arrow keys to move the fish up, down, left, and right. Press SELECT at any time to return to the start screen.
